Tired of seeing job posts in your LinkedIn feed that you're not eligible for? I built a Chrome extension that automatically filters out job posts that are exclusively for non-US applicants!
‚ú® What it does:

- Automatically greys out job posts that require Canadian/UK work authorization
- Identifies location restrictions in job descriptions
- Smart enough to allow remote positions that accept US-based candidates
- One-click to show filtered posts if you want to view them
- Zero configuration needed - works right out of the box (defaults to US)

üì• How to install:

1) Download the extension files this GitHub.
2) Open Chrome and go to chrome://extensions/
3) Enable "Developer mode" in the top-right corner
4) Click "Load unpacked" in the top-left
5) Navigate to the folder containing the extension files
6) Click OK

That's it! Visit LinkedIn and see it in action

üõ†Ô∏è Technical details:

The extension is lightweight and runs locally in your browser
No data collection or external connections
Open source and free to use
Only filters posts on LinkedIn
Preserves all LinkedIn functionality
